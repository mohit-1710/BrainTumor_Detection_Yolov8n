## **Project Motivation**

This project was undertaken as a part of a **Drone Lab assignment** at the **Scaler School of Technology**. The lab emphasizes innovative solutions, and this challenge presented an opportunity to apply deep learning to a significant real-world problem: brain tumor detection in MRI scans.

Brain tumors can be life-threatening if not detected early. Manual analysis of MRI images by radiologists is time-consuming and prone to human error. By utilizing deep learning, we can assist in speeding up the detection process while improving accuracy. This project represents both a technical challenge and an opportunity to contribute to healthcare advancements, which aligns with the Drone Labâ€™s focus on innovation and impact.


## **Data Source**
The dataset used in this project was sourced from **Kaggle**, containing **19,000 MRI brain images** annotated for tumor detection. The dataset was structured to work with the YOLOv8n model.

- **Image Format**: JPEG
- **Annotations**: Provided in YOLO format (bounding boxes for tumor regions)
- **Dataset Split**:
  - **Training Set**: Used to train the model.
  - **Validation Set**: Used during training to fine-tune the model.
  - **Test Set**: Used for final evaluation and performance metrics.

## **Environment Setup**

### Step 1: Python Installation
The project was built using **Python 3.x**. Make sure Python is installed on your system.

### Step 2: Required Libraries
Install the following Python libraries to manage the dataset, train the model, visualize results, and create the user interface:

```bash
pip install ultralytics
pip install opencv-python
pip install matplotlib
pip install pandas
pip install ipywidgets
```

- **Ultralytics**: For YOLOv8 model training and inference.
- **OpenCV**: For image processing and displaying results.
- **Matplotlib**: For plotting graphs and visualizing model performance.
- **Pandas**: To structure data and generate tables.
- **Ipywidgets**: For creating interactive widgets like file upload buttons.

### Step 3: Setting Up Jupyter Notebook
To train the model and visualize the results, **Jupyter Notebook** was used. Install it as follows:

```bash
pip install notebook
```

Once installed, launch Jupyter Notebook to train the model and monitor progress.

## **Model Training**

### Why YOLOv8n?
The **YOLOv8n** model was selected for its speed and accuracy, offering an efficient real-time object detection solution, especially suitable for identifying brain tumors in MRI images.

### Training Process
The model was trained on 19,000 MRI images using an **NVIDIA RTX 4050 GPU** to speed up the process. After many hours of training, the model was optimized and achieved excellent results in tumor detection.

## **Model Performance Evaluation**

After training, the model was evaluated on a custom test set. The following metrics were recorded:

- **Accuracy**: 0.9202
- **Precision**: 1.0
- **Recall**: 0.9202
- **F1-Score**: 0.9584

### Performance Visualization

To visualize the modelâ€™s performance, a table and bar chart were created to display the evaluation metrics.

#### **Table of Metrics**:

| Metric      | Value       |
|-------------|-------------|
| Accuracy    | 0.9202      |
| Precision   | 1.0         |
| Recall      | 0.9202      |
| F1-Score    | 0.9584      |

#### **Bar Chart**:

```python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

metrics = ['Accuracy', 'Precision', 'Recall', 'F1-Score']
values = [0.9202, 1.0, 0.9202, 0.9584]

plt.bar(metrics, values, color=['blue', 'green', 'red', 'purple'])
plt.xlabel('Metrics')
plt.ylabel('Values')
plt.title('YOLOv8n Model Performance')
plt.show()
```

This chart visually demonstrates the model's high accuracy and precision.

## **User Interface for Tumor Detection**

A user-friendly upload button was created, allowing users to upload their own MRI images. The YOLOv8n model processes the images in real-time, detects any tumors present, and draws a **bounding box** around the detected tumor. The confidence score is displayed above the bounding box.

### Upload Functionality:

```python
import cv2
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
from ultralytics import YOLO
import numpy as np
from tkinter import Tk, filedialog, Button, Label

# Load the pre-trained YOLO model globally
model = YOLO(r'C:\Users\Mohit\BrainTumor_NewYolov8n\runs\detect\train\weights\best.pt')  # Ensure the correct path to your model

# Function to perform inference on the uploaded image
def detect_tumor(image_path):
    print(f"Processing the image: {image_path}")
    
    # Read image using OpenCV
    image = cv2.imread(image_path)
    
    # Perform inference using YOLOv8 model
    results = model(image)
    print("Inference completed.")

    # Get detections (bounding boxes and confidence)
    detections = results[0].boxes.xyxy.cpu().numpy()  # Bounding boxes
    confidences = results[0].boxes.conf.cpu().numpy()  # Confidence scores

    # Check for detections
    if len(detections) == 0:
        print("No tumor detected.")
        status_label.config(text="No tumor detected.")
        return

    # Draw bounding boxes and display confidence
    print("Tumor(s) detected. Drawing bounding boxes...")
    for i in range(len(detections)):
        box = detections[i]
        confidence = confidences[i]
        if confidence >= 0.25:  # You can adjust this threshold if needed
            x1, y1, x2, y2 = map(int, box)  # Convert to integer coordinates
            cv2.rectangle(image, (x1, y1), (x2, y2), (0, 255, 0), 2)  # Draw bounding box
            label = f"Conf: {confidence:.2f}"
            cv2.putText(image, label, (x1, y1 - 10), cv2.FONT_HERSHEY_SIMPLEX, 0.5, (255, 87, 51), 1)  # Display confidence

    # Convert image from BGR to RGB for displaying
    detected_image_rgb = cv2.cvtColor(image, cv2.COLOR_BGR2RGB)

    # Display the image with bounding boxes and confidence
    plt.figure(figsize=(8, 8))
    plt.imshow(detected_image_rgb)
    plt.axis('off')
    plt.title("Detected Tumor(s)")
    plt.show()
    
    print("Image processed successfully!")
    status_label.config(text="Tumor detection completed.")

# Function to select an image using a file dialog
def upload_image():
    # Open a file dialog and return the selected file path
    file_path = filedialog.askopenfilename(title="Select an Image", filetypes=[("Image Files", "*.jpg;*.jpeg;*.png")])
    if file_path:
        print("Image selected for processing.")
        status_label.config(text="Image selected for processing.")
        detect_tumor(file_path)
    else:
        print("No image selected.")
        status_label.config(text="No image selected.")

# Initialize the main Tkinter window
root = Tk()
root.title("Brain Tumor Detection")
root.geometry("300x150")  # Set the size of the window

# Create an upload button
upload_button = Button(root, text="Upload Image", command=upload_image, width=20, height=2)
upload_button.pack(pady=20)

# Create a status label
status_label = Label(root, text="Upload an image to detect brain tumors.", wraplength=250)
status_label.pack(pady=10)

# Run the Tkinter event loop
root.mainloop()

```

### How It Works:
- **Upload Image**: Users can upload MRI images through the widget.
- **Real-Time Detection**: The model processes the image, detects tumors, and draws bounding boxes around them.
- **Confidence Score**: The confidence score for detection is displayed above the bounding box.

## **Conclusion**

The YOLOv8n model provides an effective solution for detecting brain tumors in MRI scans. With **92% accuracy** and **100% precision**, it demonstrates the potential to assist radiologists by quickly identifying tumor regions. The user-friendly interface further adds value, allowing for real-time tumor detection.

### **Future Improvements**:
- **Model Fine-Tuning**: Training the model with larger datasets could improve its performance even further.
- **Multi-Abnormality Detection**: Expanding the model to detect other brain conditions could make it a comprehensive diagnostic tool.
- **Web Application**: Future steps may include deploying this project as a web application to increase accessibility for medical professionals.
